## Scope

How long a turn may go on, and what happens when it does not stop.

## Clauses

<a id="TURN-1"></a>
### TURN-1: a bounded turn loses its tools rather than ending

A turn carries a round limit or carries none. On the limiting round the next request offers no
tools, the planner is told it has none left, and it answers with what it has. A call it asks for
anyway is dropped rather than run.

**Not a safety property.** A gate refuses on the thousandth round what it refuses on the first.
This is a bound on futility: in a directory nobody vouched for, a planner looking for a file it
cannot name will try glob after glob for as long as anyone lets it. Do not cite this clause as a
containment measure.

**Compaction is not this bound.** Compaction bounds how full the context is, not how long a turn
runs. The glob loop above stays under any budget indefinitely, so compaction is what lets it run
forever rather than what stops it. The two cover opposite failures: compaction stops a turn dying,
this stops a turn never dying.

### TURN-2: the bound belongs to the caller, and an interactive turn has none

Who is watching decides the limit, so the caller sets it. The terminal passes none: a person can
see what a turn is doing and a stop reaches it mid-round, so any number would only interrupt work
that was going fine. A one-shot `-p` run and a manifest run pass the default 200, because an
unwatched loop has nothing else to end it.

The default is bounded, because a default cannot know whether anybody is watching and being wrong
that way is the cheaper mistake. This was 40 everywhere, which interrupted real work in a large
repository.
