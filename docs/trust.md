# Trusted directories

At startup you are asked whether you trust the working directory. Trusting it means files
there are read as **trusted**, which is what lets ordinary work proceed without a prompt for
every edit. Decline and nothing is trusted, so every write is shown to you.

Trust is per path, and the **most specific rule wins**, so a trusted project can contain an
untrusted subtree, and that subtree can contain a trusted path again.

A prompt asks you one thing: **may this path stop being trusted?** That is the only
consequence a later step cannot undo, since a path recorded as untrusted can no longer be
examined or edited.

The table below is the specification.

| data | destination | prompt? | effect on the trust map |
|---|---|---|---|
| trusted | trusted | no | unchanged |
| untrusted | trusted | **yes** | that path becomes untrusted |
| trusted | untrusted | no | that path becomes trusted |
| untrusted | untrusted | no | unchanged |
| either | *never mentioned* | **yes** | that path takes the data's trust |

Writing trusted data never asks. For data to be trusted the turn must have observed nothing
untrusted, so there is no attacker-influenced byte in it, and the destination only gains trust,
never loses it.

The last row is why a path nobody has mentioned differs from one you deliberately marked
untrusted: the first has no decision behind it, so the first write there is the moment to ask.
This is also what makes declining at startup meaningful: with nothing vouched for, every write
is shown.

The second row is what closes the obvious hole. If untrusted data, meaning anything derived
from the web or from a file outside a trusted path, is written into a trusted directory, that
file is recorded as untrusted. Reading it back returns untrusted data. Otherwise a round trip
through the filesystem would launder injected text into trusted input, and the trust map would
become a bypass for the gate it exists to support.

Marking is always per file, never per directory: one untrusted file does not taint its
siblings.
